# Bankruptcy in Taiwan

In this project, I have been able to create a model that predicts bankruptcy specifically in Taiwan, based on the available data.
The dataset show high class imbalance.
I've used Gradientboosting classifier and GridSearchCV for hyperparameter fine-tuning. Accuracy score was used to determine performance.
